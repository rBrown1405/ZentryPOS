# 🏨 Hotel Mode Integration - Final Testing Guide

## Problem Resolution

**ISSUE RESOLVED**: The Hotel Mode activation was failing because the `HotelMode.activateHotelMode()` and `HotelMode.deactivateHotelMode()` methods were missing from the hotel-mode.js file.

**SOLUTION**: Added the missing methods to hotel-mode.js:
- `activateHotelMode(hotelBrand)` - Activates hotel mode with brand configuration
- `deactivateHotelMode()` - Deactivates hotel mode and cleans up data  
- `syncMenuWithRestaurant(restaurantMenu)` - Syncs room service menu for testing
