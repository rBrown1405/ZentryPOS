# Cart Display Fix - Menu Screen Issue Resolved

## ❌ **Problem Identified:**
The order cart (shopping cart) was not showing in the menu screen after the drag selection integration.

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**
The order panel (cart) was incorrectly nested inside the `tablesView` section in the HTML structure. This meant that when the tables view was hidden (which happens when switching to menu or kitchen views), the order cart was also hidden because it was a child element of the tables view.

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**
Moved the order panel outside of the `tablesView` section to be a separate top-level section within the `pos-main` container.

### **Structural Change:**

**Before (Incorrect):**
```html
<main class="pos-main">
    <section class="menu-panel" id="menuView">...</section>
    <section class="kitchen-panel" id="kitchenView">...</section>
    <section class="tables-panel" id="tablesView">
        <div>Floor plan content...</div>
        <section class="order-panel">  <!-- ❌ NESTED INSIDE TABLES VIEW -->
            <!-- Cart content -->
        </section>
    </section>
</main>
```

**After (Correct):**
```html
<main class="pos-main">
    <section class="menu-panel" id="menuView">...</section>
    <section class="kitchen-panel" id="kitchenView">...</section>
    <section class="tables-panel" id="tablesView">
        <div>Floor plan content...</div>
    </section>
    <section class="order-panel">  <!-- ✅ SEPARATE TOP-LEVEL SECTION -->
        <!-- Cart content -->
    </section>
</main>
```

## 🎯 **Result:**
- **Menu View**: Cart is now properly visible and functional
- **Kitchen View**: Cart is hidden as intended
- **Tables View**: Cart is hidden as intended (focuses on table management)
- **All existing functionality**: Preserved including drag selection and table grouping

## 🧪 **Testing Verified:**
1. Switch to Menu tab → Cart is visible
2. Add items to cart → Items appear correctly
3. Switch to Kitchen tab → Cart is hidden
4. Switch to Tables tab → Cart is hidden  
5. Switch back to Menu tab → Cart reappears with items intact

The fix maintains the intended behavior where the cart is only shown during the ordering process (menu view) while keeping it hidden during table management and kitchen operations.

## 📁 **Files Modified:**
- `pos-interface-fixed.html` - Restructured order panel placement

This was a simple but critical HTML structure fix that ensures the cart display logic in the `switchTab()` function works correctly.
